## Why Tailwind CSS is different from other framework?

Tailwind CSS is a very popular CSS framework and it is one of the best-known CSS frameworks as a low-level, utility-first, and robust choice. The framework itself can be used progressively or as a foundation for your entire design and UI.

With this framework, one of its best features is you are not locked into an opinionated structure. Everything is progressive, you can just use the pre-defined CSS classes and start building your layout and design. No annoying overriding styles, just simple build blocks that you can follow.

It provides a lot more flexibility and control over what your application looks like than other CSS frameworks. This can enable you to create a more unique site.
